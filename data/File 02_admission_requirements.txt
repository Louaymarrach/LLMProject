Additional materials may include a personal statement, recommendation letters, and a résumé for specific majors.

Graduate Admissions:
Applicants must hold a bachelor’s degree from an accredited institution with a minimum GPA of 2.75/4.0 (or equivalent). Required documents include:
- Official university transcripts
- Two recommendation letters
- Statement of Purpose outlining academic and career goals
- Proof of English proficiency (TOEFL/IELTS)
- GRE/GMAT scores for certain programs (MBA, Engineering, or Pharmacy)

Applications are reviewed holistically, with some programs requiring interviews.
